# Tips for Good Practice
* Leave yourself time to complete work
* Never write down words taken directly from another source without putting quotations arround it and referencing to where you found it
* Unless it is an in impressive quote, you are better off explaining things in your own words with a reference
* If you're using 3rd party code, reference that too!

# Bibliography
* List the sources you have used in your work
* BCS asks for an "in depth investigation of the context & literature, and where appropiate, other similar products"
* The outline project specification should contain some of the initial items you are reading.
* Building a bibliography
  * author/editors and years of publication
  * Title (book/journal)
  * Edition/Volume/Series
  * Publisher and PLace of Publication
  * Page reference
  * URLs for web resources and dates when you accessed the resource
  * Digital Object Identifiers

  ## Bibliography Styles
* Author-Date (Harvard)
* IEEE Style (Numeric)
