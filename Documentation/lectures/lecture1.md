# Law and the Legal System
* A set of rules that can be enforced in a court
* Rules can and will differ between countries
* An IT professional has to worry about rules relating to data protection, computer misuse etc
* The law is **not** the same thing as morality; you can be one and not the other
## Criminal Law
* Society's view of what is acceptable behaviour and what is not
* The police and some other agencies are responsible for apprehending those who break the criminal law
* Society, in the form of the CPS, bring them before the court
* Criminal Offenses
  * Theft
  * Murder
  * Fraud
  * Obtaining unauthorised access to a computer
## Civil Law
* Regulates the relationship between people
* Action is initiiated by the aggrieved party (the claimant)
* Neither the police nor the CPS are involved
* No element of punishment;
* To make civil law apply to companies/universities/councils you have to make them "legal persons", compared to natural persons like ourselves
* The organisation must be "incorporated" to be treated as a legal person
* For example, you cannot sue the Computer Science department, because it does not have legal existance. However, you can sue the university because it is incorporated and hence has the legal existance.
