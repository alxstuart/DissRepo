# Professional Issues in the computing Industry
* Allows accreditation to BCS, which allows you to become a chartered engineer
* Only works Thursdays and Fridays, but will reply to email all working week
* Start all emails with CS38220 at the start of the subject line



# Law and the Legal System
* A set of rules that can be enforced in a court
* Rules can and will differ between countries
* An IT professional has to worry about rules relating to data protection, computer misuse etc
* The law is **not** the same thing as morality; you can be one and not the other
## Criminal Law
* Society's view of what is acceptable behaviour and what is not
* The police and some other agencies are responsible for apprehending those who break the criminal law
* Society, in the form of the CPS, bring them before the court
* Criminal Offenses
  * Theft
  * Murder
  * Fraud
  * Obtaining unauthorised access to a computer
## Civil Law
* Regulates the relationship between people
* Action is initiiated by the aggrieved party (the claimant)
* Neither the police nor the CPS are involved
* No element of punishment;
* To make civil law apply to companies/universities/councils you have to make them "legal persons", compared to natural persons like ourselves
* The organisation must be "incorporated" to be treated as a legal person
* A legal person may be limited company, a statutory body (e.g. local councils, DVLA etc), and bodies incorporated by royal charter
* For example, you cannot sue the Computer Science department, because it does not have legal existance. However, you can sue the university because it is incorporated and hence has the legal existance.

### Civil Law Examples in the Computer Industry
* Breach of contract
* Tort (an infringment of a right leading to legal liability)
* Defamation (liable, publishing false information to damage the reputation of another company)
* Using pirated software


## Civil Law VS Criminal Law
* To be convicted of a criminal offence, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendent is guilty
* In a civil court, it is only necessary to establish the facts on the balance of probabilities
* There is also the burdon of proof; Criminal law assumes the defendent are innocent until proven guilty, so arguably a defendent does not have to argue anything against the prosecution. In civil law, both sides have the responsibility to argue who is right

## How Law is Made
* Statuate law is defined by the government
* Common law is developled by judges through decisions in courts/tribunals that decide individual cases
  * Common law may decide that times have changed so the law can be waivered.
  * The decisions of courts in all countries that use the law may be taken into account, e.g. a court in the US may look at the decisions decided by courts in Canada, Singapore etc
* Path of law creation
  * publish a green paper
  * publish a white paper
  * Introduce the bill in the house of commons where it is discussed on a number of occasions and has changes made
  * THe bill goes to the hose of lords, where the same thing happens again
